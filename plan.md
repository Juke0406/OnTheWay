# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name

**OnTheWay** ‚Äì Peer-to-peer delivery and shopping platform via web and Telegram

## Problem Statement

Buyers often want items from places they can't visit (e.g., a mall far away or overseas), while other people are already passing by or live near those areas. There is no efficient, trusted way to connect these two groups.

## Solution

A platform that matches buyers and travelers in real-time using a web dashboard and an AI-powered Telegram bot. Buyers list what they want, travelers get notified based on live location and availability, and a mock escrow process ensures both sides fulfill their end of the transaction.

## Goals & Objectives

- Enable natural-language listing creation via Telegram
- Allow buyers to deposit item cost into mock escrow
- Notify relevant travelers in real-time
- Enable fee bidding by travelers
- Require OTP verification for delivery completion
- Feature a public profile with ratings & reviews for both parties
- Provide full listing management via web app
